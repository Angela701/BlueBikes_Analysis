# BlueBikes_Analysis

/* 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Soon there will be an expansion of the Boston bikeshare system (BlueBikes) and the Mayor of Boston would like to understand how bikes move around within the system (from station to station) based on the type of rider (and other factors) and it is up to us to figure out where to expand.  

Conduct an analysis displaying the yearly trends of bike usage based on user type and trip duration (to name a few) over the last 2 years for BlueBikes.

FINDINGS:

	◉ From 2018 - 2019, users are requesting bikes at peak times (8AM and 5PM) exclusively
	◉ From 2018 - 2019, male gender users request bikes at nearly twice the amount of female users requesting bikes 
	◉ From 2018 - 2019, the most popular sought-out location that users are requesting bikes falls under June, July, August (summer season) where whether is warmer.
	◉ From 2018 - 2019, the locations highly sought out for bike usage falls under MIT Stata, MIT Mass Ave and South Station
                                               

         
RECOMMENDATIONS: 

	◉ Consider lowering the percentage of bikes during early mornings where bikes are least requested (12AM, 1AM..)
	◉ Consider marketing towards female users in order to increase revenues during expansion 
	◉ Consider expanding the availability of bikes/docks during the summer time and decrease the amount of bikes during the winter season to prevent depreciation of bikes
	◉ Consider expanding in highly populated locations such as MIT Stata, MIT Mass Ave and South Station or surrounding areas
