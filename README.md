# BlueBikes_Analysis

/* PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Soon there will be an expansion of the Boston bikeshare system (BlueBikes) and the Mayor of Boston would like to understand how bikes move around within the system (from station to station) based on the type of rider (and other factors) and it is up to us to figure out where to expand.  

Conduct an analysis displaying the yearly trends of bike usage based on user type and trip duration (to name a few) over the last 2 years for BlueBikes. */
